Hi, I‚Äôm **Mike**

I'm an Aerospace Engineering Master's student with a background in Computer Engineering

---

### What I'm Building

- **Thrust-Vector-Controlled Rocket**  
  My thesis project ‚Äî a model rocket with AI-assisted PID control for real-time flight stabilization. Built using Simulink, MATLAB, and embedded sensors (IMU, GPS, LoRa).

- **The Books Idea**  
  An automated tool that extracts the mentioned books from podcast episodes using Whisper + NLP, enriches them with metadata, and auto-generates Hugo posts with affiliate links. Check it out here: [Podcasts-to-Books](https://mcaneff.github.io/podcasts-to-books/)


### Current Interests

- Control Systems, Orbital Mechanics, and Flight Dynamics  
- Reinforcement Learning and Symbolic AI for aerospace applications  
- Arduino telemetry systems, LoRa communications, GPS/IMU data fusion  
- 3D printing for rapid prototyping of aerospace hardware  


### Currently Learning

- Embedded C for low-latency microcontroller control loops  
- Simscape Multibody + MATLAB PID tuning
